# Fick-s-2nd-Law
This project is describing a few various methods for solutions to the Wave Equation that can model Fick's 2nd Law of Diffusion and the Heat Equation. Finding code for solving generic forms of these problems has been difficult, so I am making this project for this reason.

The equation is a 2nd Order, nonlinear partial differential equation. Three approaches are compared.  An exact analytical solution, a finite difference approach, and solution using a convolution kernel.
